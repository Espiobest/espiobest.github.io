## Welcome

Welcome to my technical blog! This is where I'll be sharing detailed writeups on security exploits, web development insights, and various technical projects I'm working on.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find:

- **Security Research**: Detailed exploit writeups and vulnerability analyses
- **Web Development**: Tutorials and insights on modern web technologies
- **Project Showcases**: Deep dives into my personal and academic projects
- **Technical Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials on various topics

## Code Examples

Here's a quick example of syntax highlighting in action:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  description: string;
  tags: string[];
}

function getBlogPosts(): BlogPost[] {
  return posts.sort((a, b) =>
    new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime()
  );
}
```

And some Python:

```python
def exploit_vulnerability(target_url):
    payload = "admin' OR '1'='1"
    response = requests.post(target_url, data={'username': payload})
    return response.json()
```
